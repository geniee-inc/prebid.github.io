## Note

This is the [Geniee](https://geniee.co.jp) *Exchange* Bidder Adapter for Prebid.js and Prebid Server.

Supported media types differ between Prebid.js and Prebid Server:

- Prebid.js: banner only.
- Prebid Server: banner and video only.

{: .alert.alert-info :}
Geniee maintains three separate bid adapters. This adapter (`ex_geniee`) is independent of "Geniee SSP" (`ssp_geniee`, `zoneId` based) and "Geniee" (`dsp_geniee`, Geniee DSP) and can be used alongside them.

Please contact us at <aladdin-back@geniee.co.jp> before using the adapter. `partnerId` values are publisher-specific and are issued by Geniee; a generic value will not return bids.

Ads are served when all of the following conditions are satisfied:

- Prebid.js: the ad unit declares `mediaTypes.banner` with valid sizes. Video- or native-only ad units are rejected. Multiformat ad units that include banner are accepted, but only the banner part is sent.
- Prebid Server: the impression carries `banner`, `video` or both, on `site` or `app` inventory. See [Prebid Server](#prebid-server).
- Payment is possible in Japanese yen or US dollars.
- The request contains either `site` (with `site.page`) or `app` (with `app.bundle`).
- GDPR does not apply to the request. The Exchange does not serve GDPR territories.
  - Prebid.js: no request is sent when `gdprApplies` is true. The adapter does not add consent signals itself; values written to `ortb2` by the TCF consent module (`regs.ext.gdpr`, `user.ext.consent`) are passed through with the rest of the first party data.
  - Prebid Server: no bids are returned when GDPR applies. With the default TCF enforcement, Prebid Server does not send the request, because `ex_geniee` has no GVL ID. If the host relaxes that enforcement, the Exchange rejects requests that carry `regs.gdpr=1`.

## Bid Params

{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped }
| Name          | Scope                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Example          | Type      |
|---------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------|
| `partnerId`   | required                  | The per-publisher ID issued by Geniee. Must be an integer >= 1 (number only; string forms such as `'123'` are rejected).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `123`            | `integer` |
| `currency`    | optional (Prebid.js only) | Currency setting, `'JPY'` or `'USD'`. When omitted, the currency module's `adServerCurrency` is used, then `'USD'`. If the resolved currency is neither `JPY` nor `USD`, no request is sent. Prebid Server reads the currency off the request's `cur` instead; see [Prebid Server](#prebid-server).                                                                                                             | `'JPY'`          | `string`  |
| `placementId` | optional                  | Reporting label for the ad unit, defined by the publisher (not issued by Geniee). Use a fixed value per ad unit; if omitted, Geniee reports cannot be broken down by ad unit. Alphanumeric, hyphen and underscore, max 40 characters, case-insensitive. Sent as `imp.tagid`. If the value violates these rules, the request is still bid on, but reports cannot be broken down correctly by that `placementId`. | `'top-banner_1'` | `string`  |

## First Party Data

`ortb2` and `ortb2Imp` first party data are included in the OpenRTB request. Note the following:

- `imp.tagid` set through `ortb2Imp` is overridden when `params.placementId` is set.
- User IDs are read from `user.ext.eids` and mirrored to `user.eids`.
- The Exchange runs a first price auction only. If `at` is set to any value other than `1` through `ortb2`, no request is sent.

## OpenRTB Blocking

Support for OpenRTB blocking parameters is partial. All four parameters below are forwarded to demand partners, but only `badv` and `bapp` are enforced by the Exchange when it filters bid responses. `bcat` and `battr` are passed on to demand partners only; the Exchange does not reject a bid that violates them, so blocking depends on each demand partner honoring the value. Set them through first party data; the adapter passes them to the Exchange unchanged.

{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped }
| Parameter | Where to set                                               | Forwarded to demand partners | Enforced on bid responses by the Exchange |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `badv`    | `ortb2.badv`                                               | yes                          | yes                                       |
| `bapp`    | `ortb2.bapp`                                               | yes                          | yes                                       |
| `bcat`    | `ortb2.bcat`                                               | yes                          | no                                        |
| `battr`   | `ortb2Imp.banner.battr`, `ortb2Imp.video.battr` (PBS only) | yes                          | no                                        |

Notes:

- `badv`: every listed domain is checked against the winning bid's advertiser domains. A bid whose advertiser domain contains a listed value is dropped, so `example.com` also blocks subdomains such as `ads.example.com`. An empty array is forwarded as an explicit "nothing blocked" declaration.
- `bapp`: matched case-insensitively against the bid's app bundle.
- `bcat`: only IAB content taxonomy codes with the `IAB` prefix (for example `IAB1`, `IAB26-1`) are forwarded; codes in any other format are dropped.
- `battr`: in Prebid.js only `banner.battr` applies, since that adapter is banner-only. Prebid Server forwards `video.battr` as well.

## User Sync

On a winning response the Exchange returns a single cookie-sync URL, which the adapter registers as an iframe sync. Only the iframe type is supported; no sync is registered on a no-bid.

Prebid disables iframe syncs by default, so publishers must allow them for this bidder:

```javascript
pbjs.setConfig({
    userSync: {
        filterSettings: {
            iframe: {
                bidders: ['ex_geniee'],
                filter: 'include'
            }
        }
    }
});
```

## Prebid Server

Prebid Server supports banner and video on both `site` and `app` inventory.

- A banner needs `w` and `h`, or a `format[0]` entry to derive them from.
- A video needs `mimes`; `w` and `h` are recommended. Other `video` fields are forwarded as received.
- An impression with both `banner` and `video` is forwarded with both. If one of the two is unusable (banner without a size, video without `mimes`), only the other is sent.
- The request's `cur` must contain `JPY` or `USD`; when omitted, `USD` is assumed.
- User sync is iframe only and is skipped when GDPR applies.

`partnerId` and `placementId` are the same as in Prebid.js; `currency` is not used (the currency comes from `cur`).

```json
{
  "imp": [{
    "id": "imp-1",
    "video": {"mimes": ["video/mp4"], "w": 640, "h": 360},
    "ext": {"prebid": {"bidder": {"ex_geniee": {"partnerId": 123, "placementId": "top-video_1"}}}}
  }]
}
```
